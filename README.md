- 👋 Hi, my name is Cleo! I can be found on most sites at @chfal.
- 👀 I’m interested in herpetology, genomics, sequencing, and open source statistical software.
- 🌱 I’m currently a PhD. Candidate at Rutgers, studying Computational and Integrative Biology. I will graduate December 2026 and am currently looking for roles that combine my computational and experimental skills to drive genomic discovery.
